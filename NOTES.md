# Release procedure

Create a branch "prerel" or "prerel-number" to test pre-releases.
Just push to create artifacts that can be downloaded, or tag with
"x.y.z-dev" or "x.y.z-rcN" or 'x.y.z-pre' for create pre-releases.

Once ready, merge everything to main.  And commit. The final commit message
will be used for the release text body.

Create a tag with a "x.y.z" or "x.y.z-rel".  This will be the release
name.  Once pushed to github, it will automatically create the release.

To delete tags use:

- `git tag -d tagname` : deletes locally
- `git push origin --delete tagname` : deletes remotely
